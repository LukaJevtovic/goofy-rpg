Very simple and probably extremely unoptimized rpg game made using pygame (and numpy). You can find .zip files with prepackaged executable files for both windows and linux, made with pyinstaller. These you can run or send to someone even if they don't have python or any of its libraries.

I'm aiming to build a "roguelike dnd" at some point, with randomly selected dungeons and randomly generated encounters, bosses, items, loot, etc. Still very early in development.

Game Mechanics:
The basis of this game is currently a slightly modified version of fifth edition rules for Dungeons and Dragons, by Wizards of the Coast. Legally I am obliged to include their Open Gaming License, which you can find in the main repository, named 'SRD-OGL_v5.1.pdf'. I plan to further modify and adapt the basic DnD rules for the purposes of the game in the future.

Music and SFX:
Music during adventure - created by ZHRÃ˜ on Freesound (https://freesound.org/people/ZHR%C3%98/sounds/527321/)
